# 💫Hello, Im Spycio.Kon - Just a noob
# 💫: Hmph mmph.
  + 🥇 My vietnamese name is VTDat, but can call me ducky if u want, that's a great nickname from an old friend. I was born in the South of Vietnam… Spent most of my life in Pleiku, but now my accommodation is in … Oh you don’t need to know exactly 😁. Im in my 21s, but I’m still alone and so I ask myself why? The answer maybe I’ve spent most of my time on learning things 😆 so poor me after all. Actually not interested in women now, i fell in love with anime more than the shitty real world. 
  + 🕷️ I'm an Applied Mathematics Student but currently hate PDE and Functional Analysis T_T
  + 🐧 My target is Cyber Security Expert, and join in Redteam at ... . Think about someone who loves you look at which you do, your command you run, so excited. Maybe in the future my waifu - Shiina Mashiro will go out of the screen and she says "K0n-sama, as long as you're here, every storm in my heart turns into peace". Someone though my level is PM, cool but sr im not haha, btw i think i have a good skill, especially exploit linux system and so on. :DĐ
  + 🦢 "I code when I'm inspired — if not, I don’t". You don't get my time for free; whoever you are, there's always a price before we deal.
  + 🦆 I get bored easily, no matter the situation — it's been confirmed. <(")
